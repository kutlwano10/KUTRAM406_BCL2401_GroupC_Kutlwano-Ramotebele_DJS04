*Plan*

- Make an object that gathers all the get Html Docs
- Make an eventListner function that executes all the clicked buttons
- Make functions 

**Challenges:**
-Trying to figure out names for the function & buttons
-The code was very complex, i didnt know what is happening
-

**Solutions:**

- I grouped all the eventListners
- Made a code to be more readable and easy to improve, by making functions to handle the action that needs to take place.
- i made a main function that executes all the functions

**Improvements:**

i need to work more on understanding this approach of coding since is very important . I will also go as far as revisiting this project to try and implement other ways on how i could have solved this Problem
